# Mahjong++
 Moroccan Mahjong made by a group of students at the National School of Applied Sciences ( ENSA Marrakech ) ; It's a game based on Shanghai Mahjong, but this version has new rules and new options. We've implemented 3 levels for Player vs Player and 3 levels for Player vs Computer. It was a great time working on this project. I hope you'll enjoy it.
